/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 
 * When using bootstrap-sass, it's recommended to avoid sprockets in your stylesheets.
 * The line require_tree . tells Sprockets to include every file inside the stylesheets directory. 
 The problem is that every SASS file is compiled separately into a CSS file before the files are 
 combined so variables arenâ€™t shared between files.
* = r equire _self
